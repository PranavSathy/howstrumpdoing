        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          The results of the 2024 political election was a wake-up call for
          nearly half of the nation. Donald Trump and his party managed to sweep
          every swing state (including the so-called “Blue Wall”), the popular
          vote, the Senate, and most-likely the House of Representatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          The morning of Nov 6th, texts between family and friends for millions
          of Americans revealed two different interpretations of the historic
          election:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            That Trump was ordained by god to win the White House back and guide
            the next American Renaissance backed by the largest names in
            technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            That Trump would tear apart the institutions of democracy and that
            this would be the end of America as we have known.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          One thing was exceedingly clear, each side is perceiving a
          dramatically different truth. To half the country, we have elected a
          convicted felon, and to the other half, his convictions were
          tantamount to stifling dissent by the political elites. To half the
          country, he provides a voice for their concerns, while the other half
          feel their voice disappearing.

        <p>
          How could, in 2024, where words/actions/thoughts/policies are recorded
          on hundreds of digital mediums for the world to see transparently,
          elicit such a drastically different response?
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>
          My goal with HowsTrumpDoing.com is to educate myself, and anyone else
          who wants to join me, in tracking and chronicling the impact of the
          (as of writing) incoming Trump administration. I want to do that by
          being honest, transparent, and simply research actual facts around
          executive orders, statements, and policies drafted and/or endorsed by
          the 47th POTUS.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can think of this as an actual exercise in citizen journalism,
          with a focus on tracking all of the key economic, social, and
          environmental indicators that are possible over the course of the next
          4+ years.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>This endeavor will:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Acknowledge that the President won in a fair, democratic process
            that represented the opinions and feelings of a majority of
            Americans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Genuinely wish that he succeeds in office and acts in the best
            interests of the American public while doing so.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aim to diligently research and learn more about the impact of the
            47th POTUS on the economy, social issues, foreign policy and our
            environment.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In the process of doing all of this, I would like to invite anyone and
          everyone to help me partake in this journey that’s willing to
          contribute in any way shape and form.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am not interested in opinions, conspiracy theories, or anecdotal
          evidence; this community will be directed towards only factual,
          non-partisan, data-driven research of the impact of Trump’s policies.
        </p>

        <h2>How&apos;s It Going to Work</h2>

        <p>This project will be split into two focus areas:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Data Collection - This site should reflect a consumer financial
            website. Having key data points from trusted sources (i.e. CPI,
            Inflation, Wage Growth, Unemployment, GDP, Interest Rate, etc.)
            juxtaposed with key policies impacting them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Editorial Content - At minimum, weekly content that summarizes
            executive orders, key legislation, appointments, and/or any other
            substantive activity by the 47th POTUS will be chronicled along with
            their intended and realized impact. To the maximum extent possible
            this will be interpreted directly from source rather than through a
            partisan lens.
          </li>
        </ol>
